To extract all the colors used in this UI design, I'll analyze the image and list the hex codes of the colors present. Let me process the image now.


Analyzed
Always show details

from PIL import Image
import numpy as np
from collections import Counter

# Load the image
image_path = "/mnt/data/20250313_123758.png"
image = Image.open(image_path)

# Convert image to RGB mode (ignoring alpha channel if present)
image = image.convert("RGB")

# Resize image for faster processing
image = image.resize((image.width // 2, image.height // 2))

# Get pixel data
pixels = np.array(image).reshape(-1, 3)

# Count occurrences of each color
color_counts = Counter(map(tuple, pixels))

# Get the most common colors (to remove minor noise)
most_common_colors = color_counts.most_common(15)

# Convert to hex format
hex_colors = [f"#{r:02x}{g:02x}{b:02x}" for (r, g, b), _ in most_common_colors]
hex_colors
